Data vehicles was developed using tools such as Streamlit, Python, Pandas, Plotly and Jupyter Notebook.

The app itself is very simple and intuitive. When you open it, you will see a title that explains what you will see in the graphs below. There are buttons that activate the analysis graphs and you can also hover your mouse over the graphs to get more information!

How we developed it;

We started by doing a small comparative analysis between some aspects of the vehicles in our ad dataset and the suggested sales prices.

After some comparisons, we had the idea of ​​demonstrating how much these aspects influence the sale of the vehicle. We created some graphs in Jupyter Notebook to understand the best way to demonstrate this visually. After deciding, we moved on to the code in vs code where we implemented it with the frameworks mentioned above.

Well, this is a simple project that served as a learning experience on how web implementation works in the context of data analysis.
